Just  a little project that I made to learn backend and DBMS,  you need to change the pg client as I have used postgres as the backend, so you have to make a database named world, and make 3 tables, names "countries", "users" &amp; "visited_countries", fill the countries with the country codes and countries from the world, got the data from smw, idk
